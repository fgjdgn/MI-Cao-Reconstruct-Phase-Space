## Phase Space Reconstruction and Optimal Delay Determination
This code provides functions for phase space reconstruction and determining the optimal delay for time series analysis using the mutual information method.

### Introduction
Phase space reconstruction is a technique used to analyze the underlying dynamics of a time series. It involves reconstructing the attractor of a system by embedding the time series in a higher-dimensional space. The optimal delay parameter plays a crucial role in this process, and it can be determined using the mutual information between time series values at different delays.

### This code includes the following functionalities:

Computing mutual information between time series values at different delays.
Finding the optimal delay using the mutual information method.
Reconstructing the phase space by embedding the time series using the optimal delay and a specified embedding dimension.
Dependencies
